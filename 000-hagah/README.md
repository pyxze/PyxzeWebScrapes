This is a paid scrape I put together for http://www.hagah.com.br. One notable feature is that I was still using BeautifulSoup at this point.

florianopolis.py collects the links from the site and pickles this data. It also collects various vendor information from the site, such as the location and address.

florianopolis-logos.py downloads the logos from the site and florianopolis-fotos.py downloads the photos.
